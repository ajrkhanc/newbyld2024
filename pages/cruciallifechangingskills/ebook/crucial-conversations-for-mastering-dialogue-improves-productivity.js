                        New IT executives at Sprint realized their 1,700-person division was in trouble. Business results were abysmal—projects were characterized by delivery delays, defects, and runaway costs. Even more distressing to the arriving leaders, the employee behaviors behind the problems seemed cemented in a culture of conflict avoidance. Staffers stayed in their silos and ignored the successes or failures of other teams, even though their projects were interdependent. Directors and managers may have struggled to meet their objectives, but they were experts at assigning blame to each other.

                        The only risk people seemed willing to take was sitting on their bad news long enough for management to catch someone else behind schedule, then try to catch up while their leaders’ attention was diverted. There was a belief that bearers of bad news would be banished to lesser assignments and diminished respect. And every time leaders attempted to fix these problems, their teams were disrupted by a companywide reorganization. Internal clients were frustrated, and the executives were starting to get nervous.
