                        Eagle’s Flight™ began as a spark within the mind of our CEO Phil Geldart, a then young and up-and-coming corporate trainer, reflecting on his less-than-motivating university experiences with lecture halls, binders and droning professors. Faced with the daunting task of having to deliver time management training to a room full of senior leaders, he was determined to find a better way to deliver the outcome. He thought about the ways in which people learn and the obstacles to that learning.

                        <p className="justify mbb-15 solutionp"><i>“Maybe I could create an experience by embedding the learning into a game so people will learn without realizing they are learning”</i></p>
                        <p className="justify mbb-15">
                        That was the spark that kindled the fire. Phil developed a principle-based program that would teach the importance of planning, risk, resource and time management; how to maximize productivity from every moment. He called it Gold of the Desert Kings™. “I wanted to create something that was pragmatic and immediately applicable to the job.<i className='solutionp '>”The results were paradigm shifting.</i>
