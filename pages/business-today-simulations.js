                                    Business Today involves utilizing “discovery learning” principles and technologies to help people and organizations improve their performance. We specialize in designing generic and industry-specific simulations to facilitate effective business decision-making and address various corporate challenges.

                                    Business Today offers customized board-based business simulation to provide a holistic view of the core business drivers within a business. These simulation programs help people understand each other’s role in accomplishing strategic initiatives and delivering specific plans within a business unit.

                                    The Business Today training consists of delegates running their businesses following a trustworthy business process through a simulation board. The simulation helps them understand the detailed business flow by implementing various decisions through multiple business cycles, tracking money and other resources flow in their business operations, and analyzing business decisions, mistakes, and outcomes (financial and non-financial). It also helps take corrective actions and re-evaluate the business decisions in a particular business cycle.

                                <p>
                                    One of the significant benefits of this experiential process is its competitive nature and ability to deliver training in a fun and interactive manner. The learnings are constantly compared to their actual workplace scenario as the business simulations include client company language, business issues, and financial statement structures. Thus, by having a clear picture of their business and underlying roles, company staff and managers can improve their performance drastically to achieve the shared organizational goals.

                                <p>
                                    Business Today Simulations comprise a multi-pronged strategy to create the desired impact on people and organizations. Below is a step-by-step discussion of these vital components and how they are interconnected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Behaviorism-</b> It involves the stimulus and response mechanism where the various situations at hand determine outcomes. It helps in reinforcing the correct behavior among the participants.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Cognitivism-</b> It refers to how the brain inputs information, processes it, and stores information for later purposes. Cognitivism is also responsible for assimilating, accommodating, and linking new information to prior knowledge. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Constructivism-</b> It allows learners to construct their learnings based on predefined beliefs, paradigms, and values. Constructivism facilitates learners to discover learnings for themselves to undertake the journey of change.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Social Learning-</b> It comprises collaborative learning and group work. Social learning also focuses on learning by observing other people’s behavior and actions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                <b>Humanism-</b> This approach involves autonomy in learning that comes with a particular purpose or motives. Humanism should satisfy Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to ensure effective learning and have adult learning principles. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                <b>Brain-based Learning (BBL)-</b> It helps strengthen synapses to receive stimuli through multiple sensory inputs. Brain-based learning facilitates seamless information flow between the left and right brain for understanding learning styles. It believes that “challenge” improves learning and that the search for meaning is innate. Further, it consists of conscious and unconscious processes.
