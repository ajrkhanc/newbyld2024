                            At Blanchard, we employ a two-person system for our online courses, wherein each course community is assigned a facilitator and moderator. The moderators provoke conversations among the learners about the course content and alert the facilitators when the discussion is meaningful. Additionally, the facilitator takes any comments and stories shared by participants into account while facilitating live sessions to make these experiences more realistic and applicable. This method of cultivating a sense of belonging and responsibility keeps solo learners engaged in the course material.
