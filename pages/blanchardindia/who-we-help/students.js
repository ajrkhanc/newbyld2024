                                Today's students entering the workforce are often faced with a "sink or swim" situation, as few companies have resources dedicated to teaching new graduates the skills necessary for success. It can be overwhelming to transition from academia to a professional environment ripe with expectations of self-leading and advocating for one's trajectory. Blanchardâ€™s free Student Self Leadership program provides students with a guidebook that helps them become active role players in their own success narratives.

                                The Student Self Leadership course at Blanchard teaches the same mindset and skillset as the corporate self leadership course, but in a context that is relevant to high school students. The course has taught students how to reframe how they perceive the world for over 20 years. Our program is offered three times a year at no cost to students, along with a complimentary program for adults working with students enrolled in the program.
