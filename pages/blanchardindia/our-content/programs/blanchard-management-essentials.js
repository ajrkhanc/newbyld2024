                                When managers run into trouble, the costs are high: high turnover, low morale, low productivity, and more. Often, these performance challenges occur because they lack the basic management skills necessary for success. That's why we created Blanchard Management Essentials®: a transformational leadership training program for new managers and those who need to hone the essential skills needed to build relationships. Maintain a positive attitude towards team members, inspire engagement, and increase productivity.
