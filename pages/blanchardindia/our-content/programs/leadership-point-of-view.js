They then collaborate with Blanchard coaches and learning partners to write a compelling narrative that transforms these pivotal events into a leadership story. In turn, leaders share their experiences with colleagues and colleagues.

                                                    LPOV can be delivered as a one-on-one coaching process that includes an orientation meeting (in person or virtual) followed by a minimum of four one-on-one coaching sessions scheduled over three to six weeks. It coaches a senior-level manager, one-on-one, to create their LPOV in preparation for them to present it as a demonstration to a group of leaders from their organization attending a cohort learning experience.
