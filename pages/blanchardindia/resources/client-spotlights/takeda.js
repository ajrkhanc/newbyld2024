                                            <p>
                                            Takeda has launched a new, comprehensive sales approach that requires salespeople to have a firm grasp on their customers’ needs. They must use critical thinking skills, conduct research, and put a large amount of time into the preparation for each sales call. A few months after the launch of the new selling approach, they realized that sales leaders needed more support as they coached their teams through this change in process.
