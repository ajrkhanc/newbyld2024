                                    In this episode Amer Kaissi shares results of his extensive research into the traits that define strong, effective leaders from his new book, Humbitious: The Power of Low-Ego, High-Drive Leadership. Conventional thinking has us believe that those filled with hubris and a lack of self-doubt make the best leaders. However, he explains how the unique combination of humility and ambition are the most important skills a leader can use. Humbitious leaders integrate humility into their relationships with others to drive results for their organizations.
