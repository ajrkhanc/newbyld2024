                                    In this episode, hear Liz Wiseman reveal the secrets of stellar professionals who play the game at a higher level from her new book, Impact Players: How to Take the Lead, Play Bigger, and Multiply Your Impact. Drawing on insights from leaders at top companies, Wiseman explains what the most influential players are doing differently, how small, and seemingly insignificant differences in how we think, and act can make an enormous impact, and why—with a little coaching—this mindset is available to everyone who wants to contribute at their highest level.
